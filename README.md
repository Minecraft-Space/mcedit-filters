##### [Simple Find and Replace](https://github.com/qqii/mcedit-filters/blob/master/SimpleFindandReplace.py) #####
A simple find and replace filter. This filter looks through entities and tile entities and tries to find and replace any text it can. This includes entity names, item lore, text is books, titles and even the player name. 
It currently has an option to blacklist certain tag names. It also supports regex for finding strings.

##### [REPL](https://github.com/qqii/mcedit-filters/blob/master/REPL.py) #####
A read-eval-print-loop for MCEdit, allowing programmers to quickly and easily experiment with code. MCEdit provides a simple way to select world, render world and an undo feature. As the windows versions comes pre-packaged with python2.7 it also saves the hastle of downloading and configuring virtualenviroments.
To use this filter, select an area in the world and run the filter. Then type code into the command prompt as you would do with any repl. When you have finished editing the world, type "exit" to exit and return to the MCEdit gui.
